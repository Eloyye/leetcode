# Ford Fulkerson

## Description
The Ford Fulkeron algorithm is used to find the maximum flow in a graph. It is a greedy algorithm that finds the maximum flow by finding the shortest augmenting path from the source to the sink. 
### Augmenting
An augmenting path is a path from the source to the sink that has available capacity. The capacity of an augmenting path is the minimum capacity of all the edges in the path.
